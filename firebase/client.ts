// Clerk Authentication Client
// This file is now replaced with Clerk authentication
// Authentication is handled by Clerk components and hooks

// For backward compatibility, we export null values
// These will be replaced by Clerk hooks in components
export const auth = null;
export const db = null;

// To use authentication in components, import from Clerk:
// import { useUser, useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";
// import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server"; // for server components
